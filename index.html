        Call of Duty: Mobile was developed by TiMi Studios, a subsidiary of Tencent Games, in collaboration with Activision. It was officially released on October 1, 2019. The game was designed to bring the Call of Duty franchise's iconic first-person shooter action to mobile devices, combining traditional multiplayer modes with a battle royale experience. While TiMi Studios handled the development, Activision, the publisher of the Call of Duty series, provided the game's intellectual property and oversight.
